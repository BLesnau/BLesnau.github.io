# Accessbility For Developers

## Intro
About 9 months ago, some pain came on very suddenly in both of my arms and it started to impact how I was able to work and take part in my hobbies. That led me to try various things to help with the discomfort, including different hardware and software changes. In case others run into similar problems or are just interested, this post will mention a lot of those things that I tried. I am attemtping to not go too in-depth with any topic and intend for this to be a quick overview and mention of things at a high level. If you want more detail on anything, just let me know.

This is written mostly from the perspective of a software developer, but most things could apply to anyone that uses a computer.

### Medical Stuff
I won't give a ton of detail about the medical stuff because I don't think it will be very helpful. It will be different for everyone that runs into pain when using a computer and it's better to talk with a doctor. For at least a little context, my pain was in my wrist, forearm, and thumbs. It was diagnosed as two different types of tendonitis, [Intersection Syndrome](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/intersection-syndrome), and [De Quervain Tenosynovitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Quervain_syndrome).

## Keyboard Hardware
The biggest change that I think helped me was experimenting with different keyboards. There are plenty of ergornomic keyboards when looking around on the intenet. These do things like slightly angle the keys, but the next step after that is a keyboard that is fully split down the middle into two parts. This is a topic that you can dig into endlessly, but I tried a few things and settled on a few changes that have improved my situation overall.

### Split Keyboards
As mentioned above, some ergornomic keyboards are a single piece, but split in the middle. This can provide some tenting (mentioned below) and separation to keep your shoulders further apart.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22bd044e-21ad-44a0-8d2f-d0ebebd34e4f)

This wasn't a drastic enough change to help me, so I went with a fully split option where the keyboard is split into two separate pieces. This gives you maximum configurability with how far apart your shoulders are and tilting / tenting of each half separately. Below, I mention each of the variables for how I set up my split keyboards in more detail.

### Keyboards I Now Use
I will go into more detail below regarding the properties I considered when getting a new keyboard, but I wanted to start out by just showing the keyboards I have been using.

The first is the [Glove80](https://www.moergo.com/collections/glove80-keyboards).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35fa94bd-04fc-4e2d-a66f-9347b61331b9)

- 80 low-profile keys and keycaps. I stick to around 34 keys though.
- Close to lightest low-profile switches available.
- Columnar layout where columns are lined up with each other.
- Keywell for your hand to rest inside of and to prevent your fingers needing to reach far for some keys.
- Built-in palm rest to keep your arms in a more neutral position.
- Not hot-swappable, so you can't change the switches without desoldering and soldering.

The second is a [Ferris Sweep Bling](https://keebmaker.com/products/ferris-sweep?variant=47650331590955).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df8ac920-5f76-4bc0-9ad4-3a819453cbf8)

- 34 low-profile keys and keycaps. I configured my other keyboard to use only around 34 keys so that I can switch between both keyboards more easily.
- Pretty much the lightest low-profile switches available.
- Columnar layout where columns are lined up with each other.
- More extreme stagger toward the pinky columns so that your pinky does not need to reach as far.
- Hot-swappable so that you can change the switches easily.

### Tilt
Many keyboards tilt up a little. Many people gave conflicting suggestions about ergonomics online, including my physical therapist and doctors. One of the few things that most people seemed to agree on was that the keyboard tilting up (positive tilt) was not good. Some even reccommended a tilt down away from your body (negative tilt) if possible with a keyboard tray.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5c2e090-3cc1-4f88-a262-d80a4816aea2)

A few years ago, I switched to a low profile keyboard with almost no tilt. The keyboard also had low profile switches and low profile keycaps. This helped some minor pain I had back then and it became more important recently.

### Tenting
Tenting is the keyboard tilting toward the sides rather than away or towards your body. This is only really possible with a keyboard that is split in the middle in some way since each side of the keyboard needs to tilt in a different direction.

Both of the keyboards that I use provide some form of tenting, but the smaller one is easier to attach to mounts with magnets for maximum tenting.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac83e891-ee3f-4287-8fc7-2ca2707fa7bf)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/294595e2-2c9a-40c6-9534-9cba8f11abb9)

Tenting seemed to help a lot of other people, but it was a minor change for me. Too much tenting actually caused me more pain. More tenting meant that my I was not able to use a palm rest as easily, and resting every so often helped decrease tension and pain.

### Keywells
Concave keywells let you position your hand so that your fingers rest "inside" of the keyboard. This helps prevent your wrist from bending upwards and helps decrease strain. Typing with a keywell was much more comfortable for me, especially when combined with a palm rest. You can see an example of keywells in the Glove80 picture above.

Keywells are one of the more rare features that you can find in a keyboard. The extra manufacturing complexity means you usually can't change the switches without desoldering first and it also drives the price up higher.

### Low-Profile Key Switches And Keycaps
Low-profile switches and keycaps are exactly what they probably sound like. The first purpose for both of them is that they help keep the overall height of the keyboard lower so that it's easier to prevent your wrist from tilting up.

The second benefit for the switches is that they have a lower actuation distance. This means that you don't need to push the key down as far. This could cause some discomfort and be hard to get used to if you keep bottoming-out on the key presses. That extra shock can cause some pain.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85b7b40c-d6a6-4f69-a622-490408d989f8)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf72ead0-0190-4d18-8621-4c257cd26d85)

This is one of the first changes that I tried years ago. Once I got used to this and typed a bit softer, it has helped at least a little bit.

### Low Actuation Force Switches
Low actuation force switches just mean that you don't need to push the keys with as much force when typing. This sort of goes along with the low-profile switches mentioned above. Lower actuation force switches allowed me to type softer and move my fingers less. It was another minor improvment to add to the list that helped me out overall.

### Columnar Key Layout
Most standard keyboards have keys that are staggered from the rows above and below them. This means that the columns are not lined up with each other. This causes some people to reach different keys in unnatural ways. A columnar key layout tries to address this by putting all columns in line with each other. It helps your fingers focus on mostly moving up and down rather than to the side.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f39f6d5b-d034-47ff-86ae-c38c8d43ec83)

This may be a minor improvement for most people, but I don't know that it helped my pain in more than a subtle way. It did make typing feel more comfortable and accurate once I got used to it.

### Staggered Key Rows
As mentioned above, most standard keyboards have keys that are staggered from the rows above and below them. This means that the columns are not lined up with each other. Rows are typically lined up with each other. This is often not ideal because your varying finger lengths make it harder to reach certain keys. This is especially true with pinky fingers.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c4d46d3-58dd-4b3e-9d97-610364b3d4b3)

Both keyboards that I settled on have a form of row stagger that helped me. The keywell in the Glove80 has some columns raised a little higher so that your finger needs to reach a shorter distance. Both the Glove80 and the Sweep have the rows lowered near your pinky finger. This was a very positive change for me overall and let my hands rest more natually and not need to reach as much.

### Thumb Cluster
Almost all split keyboards have a cluster of keys towards the inside of the keyboard. These are usually meant to be hit with your thumbs. Part of the thought for this is that your thumb is rarely used on standard keyboards and that spreading key presses out across more fingers could help reduce strain overall. This wasn't 100% true for me because part of my pain was in my thumbs. Most of the pictures I have already included show a thumb cluster of keys.

The part that helped me a lot was putting "special" keys in the thumb cluster like Enter, Backspace, Space, Shift, Control, etc. Those keys are all accessible to me without rotating my wrists now.

## Software

### Window And Application Management
I usually used `Alt-Tab` or `Cmd-Tab` to switch between open applications. Holding those keys down hundreds of times each day caused pain. I tried options that allow you switch to specfic applications with separate hotkeys. For example, one hotkey will open or focus my browser, one will do the same for Slack, one for Outlook, etc.

This helped me a lot. I found that holding keys down was something that triggered my pain quickly.
- Not holding keys and less switching to the mouse as an alternate way to get to other applications improved things.
- Keeping my hands on the keyboard more often than the mouse helped.

I tried a few apps but I settled on one for Mac and one for Windows.
  - [Apptivate](http://www.apptivateapp.com/) for Mac
  - [Clavier+](https://gryder.org/software/clavier-plus/?lang=en) for Windows

### Vim
I enabled Vim mode in all of my IDEs like Xcode, Visual Studio, CLion, and VSCode. I initially tried using NeoVim as my actual IDE, but that was too much of a learning curve for all of the languages that I jump between. The Vim motions were what was actually beneficial, so I decided to integrate Vim as best as I could into the IDEs that I was already using.

A lot of developers have already seen or used Vim motions. It lets you do most text and code editing without using a mouse. It also provides functionality that you don't have even with a mouse. For example, you can record a complex set of actions as a macro and replay it repeatedly. Vim motions can be a deep topic that many developers are already very passionate about and I have finally spent the time to make them work for me.
  - Using the keyboard more rather than the mouse helped the pain a bit.
  - Less switching between mouse and keyboard helped.

### Voice Control
When I first started dealing with the pain, it was bad enough that I couldn't tolerate using a keyboard or mouse. I initially tried using voice control software as a short-term solution.

Both Mac and Windows include functionality for voice control or at least voice dictation. It worked alright as a last resort for dictating text, but it was much worse at helping with code or controlling your computer with functionality like opening applications.

Since the OS functionality was not working out, I looked into a few other options. The best one that I found was [Talon Voice](https://talonvoice.com/). It was originally aimed at helping software developers specifically. It is highly configurable and parts of it are open source. It is also free, but you can subscribe to a Patreon to get extra features.
  - Dictation mode works well for typing sentences. It also lets you say special keys like `question mark` or `dollar sign`.
  - Command mode is used for things like opening or focusing applications. It worked really well for avoiding shortcuts that required holding keys down like Alt-Tab and Cmd-Tab to cycle through applications.
   - You can control the mouse by displaying a grid with coordinates and using those coordinates as parts of a spoken command to move the mouse or click a mouse button.
   - You can write your own Python code to extend the functionality. A public repository exists with plenty of existing examples and real use cases.
     - I wrote my own code to control the mouse with a hissing sound. Talon already included functionality to detect sounds like hissing and popping. The mouse would start moving right when hissing and then stop when the hissing stopped. It would then move down with the next hiss, and then left and up after that. It took less than 30 minutes to write that code and would be even faster if it wasn't my first integration with Talon.
  - Integrations exist with other applications like browsers and IDEs to make web browsing and writing code even easier.

Overall, finding and using something like Talon Voice successfully was surprising. It was hard to get used to and I was not efficient yet, but it's nice knowing there is an option like that if I ever had to resort to much less keyboard and mouse usage.

## Keyboard Configuration

### Sticky Keys
Both Mac and Windows have this feature. It lets you have modifier keys like Shift and Control act like they're being held down with a single tap. Holding keys down caused pain for me, so this feature helped a lot. It's especially good for shortcuts that require you to hold two or three modifier keys at the same time. I configured my keyboard to use sticky keys like this without requiring the OS feature to be turned on.

### Keyboard Layout
You may have heard of [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) as an alternate key layout that people have been switching to for decades. Part of the benefits are typing accuracy, but there are supposed to be some benefits for comfort as well.
   - Prioritizes keeping fingers on the home row and alternating keypresses with each hand.
   - Layout is quite a bit different than QWERTY, so common shortcuts like copy and paste are hard to get used to.

There are many options but a newer option that many people online reccommended was [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/)
   - Prioritizes keeping your fingers on the home row or at most one column or row away from that.
   - Avoids moving index finger to inner column.
   - Many common shortcuts like copy and paste stay in similar positions.

Below are some heatmap images for different layouts that I looked at.

**QWERTY**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31760143-87b7-45d5-b97f-e30fe6c0dafc)

**Dvorak**

**Colemak-DH**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a50e1223-69df-4457-870e-5af05d8f1a37)

I ended up sticking with QWERTY. I think Colemak-DH would be helpful in the long run, but learning a new layout caused my wrists to be more tense and it would take a while for me to be more relaxed when typing.

### Smaller Number Of Keys
As mentioned above, one of my new keyboards has only 34 keys, so I configured both keyboards to use that many keys. This is 30 "normal" keys where you find letters and some punctuation like period and comma. The 4 other keys are in the thumb cluster for more "special" keys. You need to use layers to get access to all of the other keys.

Holding certain keys switches to other layers where the keys are doing something different. This is the same thing that holding the Shift key does for typing symbols or capital letters. For example, my default layer has the letters and some punctuation and my other layers include symbols, numbers, arrows, Tab, Escape, etc.

The smaller number of keys allows me to move my hands and fingers less and reduced my overall strain quite a bit.

### Homerow Modifier Keys
Since holding modifier keys like Control caused pain, I looked for alternate ways of using these keys and I stumbled across homerow mods. This makes holding some keys act as a different key than when tapping them. For example, my F and J are Control/Command and my D and K are Shift.

This helped a lot by allowing my hands to not move a lot to hit modfier keys and not have my thumbs get too overworked with the thumb cluster. I can switch between the two modifier key layouts as needed.

## Mice / Pointing Devices
I tried a few different mice to improve things, but I did not end up focusing on this too much. It would only help one hand and my problem was in both hands.

### Vertical Mice
A "normal" ergonomic mouse is tilted a bit to allow your hand to lay in a more neutral position rather than completely flat. It wasn't enough to help me. The more extreme version of this is usually called a "vertical mouse". It lets your hand rest so that your hand is almost in a "thumbs up" position, which is supposed to be easier on your wrist. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86cdf01e-18fb-42cb-b4cb-5ba77ec076e4)

This helped a little for me, but it sometimes seemed to bother my specfic thumb problem more. If the pain was isolated to the wrists and not in the thumb at all, I think this would help some more.

One that felt a little more comfortable was what looks like a joystick. Your hand is still vertical, but the main button is on top for your thumb to hit.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fe5ade3-ca43-4c62-a0e1-aeb99e4bda37)

This feels very comfortable for me for a short period of time, but it quickly starts to bother my thumb. I only saw one real option for a mouse like this, which leads me to think that it's not very popular and may not be very helpful for most people.

### Mouse Palm Rest
Similar to a keyboard palm rest helping keep your wrist in a  comfortable position when typing, a palm rest when using the mouse could be helpful as well. This isn't usually an option because your mouse hand moves too much to make use of a palm rest. Some mice have a palm rest built in that moves with the mouse, but I went with a different option that glides with your hand. There are a few different options, but the most popular brand seems to be [Carpio](https://deltahub.io/products/carpio-ergonomic-wrist-rest?view=carpio2024-compare_table).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07230fa2-5fae-4eb2-9946-e2d26222ad75)

This has surprisingly helped fairly quickly. It takes some time to get used to, but preventing my wrist from bending upwards and keeping it laying more flat made it feel more comfortable almost immediately.

### Trackpad
I didn't have high hopes for using a trackpad, but I wanted to gived it a shot. I used a separate Apple [Magic Trackpad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2D3AM/A/magic-trackpad-white-multi-touch-surface).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b05e2c5c-081c-49a9-a8ee-b52870a5d40b)

It kept my hand too tense while trying to use it, so it was a worse change overall. 

### Eye Trackers
I did not look into eye trackers much for controlling the mouse cursor. There is hardware and software to help with this, but the general consensus online was that it is not good for accurate movements like clicking a small button. It works alright for things like playing a video game, but not for using software.

I did try features included with macOS to control the mouse with your eyes or head movement, but it was very hard to control and not accurate at all. It's good that it's there as a last resort, but it was not very good if you have other options.

## Summary
Overall, no change that I made got rid of the discomfort and no single thing made a huge impact on its own. It took a lot of tiny improvements to make things better, and the problem still won't completely go away. If you're interested, making changes before you have any pain is of course better than waiting until things get worse.

Like I mentioned at the top, I tried to keep this relatively concise. It ended up being longer than I wanted, but I tried to keep each section on the shorter side. If you have questions about any further details or are curious about anything I mentioned here, let me know.

Thanks for reading.
